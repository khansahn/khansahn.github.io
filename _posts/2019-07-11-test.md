Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

It's all actually thanks to [JmcGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), I'm literally following his every steps.
